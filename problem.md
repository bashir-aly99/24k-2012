Objective 3: Algorithms
• Task 1:
Problem: Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a
divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.
Solution:
1. Ask the user to enter number1 (Dividend)
2. Ask the user to enter number2 (Divisor)
3. Check for remainder, number1 % number2 == 0
4. If true, display number2 is divisor of number1 else display number2 is not divisor of number1.
5. Check if divisor is even or odd, number2 % 2 == 0
6. If true, display the divisor is even else display the divisor is odd.
